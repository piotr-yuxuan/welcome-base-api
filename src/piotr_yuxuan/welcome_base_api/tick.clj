;; At the beginning of the day, a tick value is at 0, meaning that the
;; price is at bod-price.  A tick value of `(int Short/MIN_VALUE)`
;; means that market value has been reduced to 0. A tick value of
;; (int Short/MAX_VALUE) means that market value has been multiplied
;; by 2. I chose to use the numeric type `integer` because it is the
;; fastest according to some unprecise tests benchmark below.

;; The value domain and type of market-value is BigDecimal, the value
;; domain of tick-value is that of Short while its type is Integer. A
;; tick-value is an approximation of a market-value which allow fast
;; and approximation-free computations.

;; As Y-fast trie datastructures are sensitive to the size of the
;; domain values, `short` then would be way better than `integer` but
;; the latter is way faster. A solution would be to use integer type
;; but restrict the value domain to that of shorts.  With things that
;; fast, no need to look into `SkipTrie` (= concurrent Y-fast trie)
;; yet.
